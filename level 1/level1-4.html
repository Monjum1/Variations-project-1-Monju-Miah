    <body>
        <br><br><br><br><br> Still, I keep myself, I take
        <br><br><br><br><br><br>to bed. One lung is red. Cut red
        <br><brflowers hung in pink water.
        
        <br><br>My other lung is out of line.
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From one lung, I tell the truth.
        From the other lung, I lie.
        Cut pink flowers hung in red water.
        
        Like a pain,<br><br><br> the truth is mine.
        The &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;lie is that today I want to die.
        Cut red water hung in pink flowers.
        
        The rest of it is stillness, rest.
        A soft &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;cough into a hard pan.
        A hard cough into a soft plane.
        Cut pink water hung in red flowers
