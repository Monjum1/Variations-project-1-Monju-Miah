        <p> Still, I keep myself, I take
      to bed. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One lung is red.&nbsp;&nbsp; Cut red
      flowers hung in pink water. </p>

      <p> My other <br>lung <br> is out of line.
      From one lung, I tell the truth.
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the other lung, I lie.
      Cut pink flowers hung in red water.</p>

      <p>Like a &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;pain,&nbsp;&nbsp; the truth is mine.
        - The lie is that<br><br> today I want to die.
      Cut red water hung in pink flowers.</p>

     <p> The - &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; rest of it is stillness, rest.
      A soft cough into a hard pan.
      A hard<br><br> cough into a soft plane.
      Cut pink water hung in red<br><br><br><br><br> flowers</p>
