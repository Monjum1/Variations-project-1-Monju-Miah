      <em>  Still, I keep myself, I take
        to bed. One lung is red. Cut red
        flowers hung in pink water. </em>

        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;other lung is out of line.
        From one lung, I tell the truth.
        From the other lung, I lie. 
        Cut pink flowers hung in red water.

       <big>Like a pain, the truth is mine.
        The lie is that today I want to die.
        Cut red water hung in pink flowers.</big>

        The rest of it is stillness, rest.
        A soft&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; cough into a hard pan.
        A hard cough into a soft plane.
        Cut pink water hung in red flowers
