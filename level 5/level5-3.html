    <body>
      <div> <p>Still, I keep myself, I take
        to bed. One lung is red. Cut red
        flowers hung in pink water.</p>
        <br>
       <p> My other lung is out of line.
        From one lung, I tell the truth.
        From the other lung, I lie.
        Cut pink flowers hung in red water.</p>
        <br>
       <p> Like a pain, the truth is mine.
        The lie is that today I want to die.
        Cut red water hung in pink flowers.</p>
        <br>

        <p>The rest of it is stillness, rest.
        A soft cough into a hard pan.
        A hard cough into a soft plane.
        Cut pink water hung in red flowers</p> </div>
    </body>
