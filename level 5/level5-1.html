    <h1>The Rest</h1>
    <h2>Jane Hoffman</h2>

    <body>
       <big> Still, I keep myself, I take
        to bed. One lung is red. Cut red
        flowers hung in pink water.</big>
<br>
<br>
        <small>My other lung is out of line.
        From one lung, I tell the truth.
        From the other lung, I lie.
        Cut pink flowers hung in red water.</small>
        <br>
        <br>

       <big> Like a pain, the truth is mine.
        The lie is that today I want to die.
        Cut red water hung in pink flowers. </big>
        <br>
        <br>

       <small>The rest of it is stillness, rest.
        A soft cough into a <strong> hard pan. </strong>
        A hard cough into a soft plane.
        Cut pink water hung in red flowers </small>
    </body>
