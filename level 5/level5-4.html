<h1>The Rest</h1>
<h2>Jane Hoffman</h2>
<br>
    <body>
       <div>Still, I keep myself, I take
        to bed. One lung is red. Cut red
        flowers hung in pink water.
        <br>
        <br>

        My other lung is out of line.
        From one lung, I tell the truth.
        From the other lung, I lie.
        Cut pink flowers hung in red water.
        <br>
        <br>

        Like a pain, the truth is mine.
        The lie is that today I want to die.
        Cut red water hung in pink flowers.
        <br>
        <br>

        The rest of it is stillness, rest.
        A soft cough into a hard pan.
        A hard cough into a soft plane.
        Cut pink water hung in red flowers </div>
        

    </body>
