    <h1> The Rest </h1>
    <h2> Jane Hoffman </h2>
    <body>
        Still, I keep myself, I take
        to bed. One <big>lung</big> is red. Cut red
        flowers hung in pink water.
 
        <br>
        <br>
        <br>
       <ol> My other <small> lung </small> is out of line.
        From one lung, I tell the truth.
        From the other lung, I lie.
        Cut pink flowers hung in red water. </ol>
        <br>
        <br>
        <br>

        <div>Like a pain, the truth is mine.
        The lie is that today I want to die.
        Cut red water hung in pink flowers.</div>
        <br>
        <br>
        <br>

        <ol>The rest of it is stillness, rest.
        A soft cough into a hard pan.
        A hard cough into a soft plane.
        Cut pink water hung in red flowers</ol>
    </body>
