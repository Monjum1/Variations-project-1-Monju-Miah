        <p><div class="highlight"> Still, </div>  I keep myself, I take
        to bed. One lung is red. Cut red
        flowers hung in pink water.</p>
        <br>
        <br>
        <p> My other <strong>lung</strong> out of line.
        From one lung, I tell the truth.
        From the other <small>lung</small>, I lie.
        Cut pink flowers hung in red water.</p>
        <br>
        <br>
        <p> Like a pain, the truth is mine.
        The lie is that today I want to <strong> die.</strong>
        Cut red water hung in pink flowers. </p>
        <br>
        <br>
        <p> The rest of it is stillness, rest.
        A <small>soft cough</small> into a hard pan.
        A <strong> hard cough </strong> into a soft plane.
        Cut pink water hung in red flowers</p> </header>
